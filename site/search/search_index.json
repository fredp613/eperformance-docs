Users are initially brought to the landing page, where they are able to begin the submission process. Registration and Login Once a user has navigated to the landing page for the Intake+ portal, there is an option for them to sign in if they have previously registered or register as a new user. If previously registered, users will be able to enter their login information to access available forms and profile information. If the user needs to register, they must complete the required registration information. This includes: first name, last name, email address, password, and password confirmation. Client Profile Client profiles are used for the management of clients within the portal system. Here, clients are defined as individuals that interact with programs. This differs from portal users, who will log into an account for the management of client submissions. Clients create and submit applications through the portal. To create a new client user, follow the steps below. 1. Navigate to Client Profiles. 2. Click the Add New (+) icon. 3. Complete the dialog by filling out information for profile type and name. To create a profile type, follow the steps below. To edit a client user, follow the steps below. To delete a client user, follow the steps below. There are various roles associated to clients. By default, a user will have an administrator role for their clients. [^1] This can be changed using the client user page. Available roles include administrator, contributor, and read-only. As an administrator, a user can read and edit client information as well as start, edit, and submit applications on behalf of clients. As a contributor, a user can read client information as well as start, edit, and submit applications on behalf of the client. They are unable to edit client information. A read-only user will only be able to view the profiles of their clients. They are unable to edit client information and cannot start, edit, or submit client applications. [^1]: It is important to note that an administrator is different to an administrative user. Administrators have full access to administrative tools found within Ralph, such as the form manager. Service Amendments Tenant Manager Multiple Tenants Adaptor Customizing Intake Portal SaaS Form Manager Orbeon Overview Forms are generated using Orbeon Forms, which is a web-based application that provides a platform for easily designing forms. This solution can handle the building and deployment of large web forms with complex validation, making it a very useful tool for enterprises and governmental organizations. Administrators have access to use this solution to generate forms directly from the Ralph portal in a browser. This tool uses a WYSIWYG editor style, where the administrator is able to immediately see how the form looks as it is being built. All forms built through Orbeon are accessible via desktop and laptop computers, as well as mobile devices. \u2022 Validation, visibility, calculations, and branching \u2013 Define validation rules; Specify errors, warnings, and alert messages to be displayed; Define visible and editable fields; Automatically calculate and populate values \u2022 Repeating sections and tables \u2013 Groups of fields can be repeated; Set a minimum and maximum number of items allowed; Reorder items for convenience \u2022 Encryption \u2013 Select encryptions for specific fields in database; Comply with various data protection and privacy regulations \u2022 Actions and services \u2013 Specify HHTP and database service endpoints \u2022 PDF generation \u2013 Generate PDF files with data entered by users; Based on layout of web form or from a template \u2022 Multi-page forms \u2013 Navigation between form pages so users are not overwhelmed by large forms; See errors associated to given form pages and easily navigate to the appropriate page Create, Edit, Configure, and Activate Forms There are various types of forms to be created within the Ralph portal. Such forms are listed and further described below. \u2022 Application \u2013 For the submission of grants or programs \u2022 Assessment \u2013 Reviews, checklists, evaluations, and other assessments for a grant or program \u2022 Claim \u2013 Funding recipient to request payment at various times throughout the life cycle of the project \u2022 Profile \u2013 For information about a client\u2019s name, number, description, status, and associated actions \u2022 Reviewer Profile \u2013 For information about a reviewer \u2022 Survey \u2013 For users to complete and submit forms, there must first be forms available for them to access. These are to be created by administrative-level users working with the various form types. Administrators must navigate to the Forms section, where an initial dropdown menu option is selected. The user will proceed to the View section. Here, the available types of forms as well as existing forms will be listed. To create a new form, under the Forms grid, select the Add New button as denoted by the \u201c+\u201d sign. This will prompt for required information, such as the form\u2019s code, type, and initial form version name. Once the form has been initially generated, there is another Add New button located under the form name. Use this to create a new version of a form. It is possible to base the new form off a previous version by selecting to copy contents of an existing form and then adding the required changes. Every version is stored under its parent form, as shown above when expanding the parent form. Additional form information is also displayed, such as the form\u2019s version, name, status, activation version, created on date, and last modified on date. From here it is possible to edit, configure, activate, and view the forms. These are denoted by icons to the right of the form version and discussed in upcoming subsections. From the Orbeon form creator, it is possible to create a form from scratch or edit an existing form. The side panel provides all the tools and functionalities available to create and edit a form. The following features are found in the side panel. 1. Cut, copy, and paste 2. Undo/redo insert control 3. Form settings \u2013 Options for general settings that apply to the entire form definition (application name, form name, form title, and description), form options (maximum attachment size, allowed file types, appearance of control labels and hints, and automatic calculation dependencies), control settings (number, currency, date, and time), wizard options (views, navigation validation, subsection navigation, and subsection table of contents), and about this form (versions and form statistics) Form Controls Data Mapping and Sync to CRM Auto-numbering The Ralph portal has the option for automatic program numbering associated with given schemas, such as case files, submissions, and accounts. Each of these schemas will be associated with a given competition. It is possible to customize the naming conventions for the automatic numbering system as shown below. Navigate to Forms. Select Tools from the dropdown menu and then select Auto Numbering. Select the program to be customized. Click Edit, as denoted by the pencil icon to the right of the selected program. This will display a dialog window. Ensure that the program details are correct by verifying the program and schema name.

Translation Management As with an IIPS, Ralph uses a translation manager to toggle a form\u2019s language between English and French. This is done following a specific protocol to ensure the feature\u2019s functionality. When a field is created on a form, click the control setting icon. Once in the \u201cSettings\u201d screen, go to the \u201cLabel\u201d tab. The label should be formatted to have a \u201c_\u201d value in front of the label name for French translations. This is the display key for translations. Click \u201cApply\u201d to have the setting be saved. This is shown below. A list of all in-use translations is found under the Orbeon configurator. The available translation keys are displayed in a grid containing both the English and French translations. From here, translations can be edited and deleted by navigating to the appropriate icon. User Management Administrator accounts can log into the Intake+ Forms Manager to access portal user information. Here, it is possible to change and reset passwords. This is shown below. Navigate to Portal Users. Select the profile to be changed. Click the edit icon to the right of the user, as denoted by a key. Enter and confirm a new password in the dialog box. Click Save. A user can be disabled for various reasons. This should only be done when the user is no longer required or permitted to access the Ralph portal. Follow the steps below to disable a user. Navigate to Portal Users. Select the profile to be changed. Click the disable icon to the right of the user, as denoted by a circle containing an \u201cx\u201d.
